#DdosHping3

Welcome to the **DdosHping3** repository! This project provides a bash script that allows users to simulate various network attack scenarios using `hping3`. The script offers a user-friendly interface for selecting attack types, targeting specific IPs, and managing multiple terminal instances for concurrent execution.

##Introduction

This repository serves as a tool for educational purposes, particularly in understanding network security, penetration testing, and the implications of various types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. By using this script, users can experiment in a controlled environment to learn how these attacks work and how to defend against them.

##Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **hping3**: This tool is essential for crafting and sending custom TCP/IP packets. The script will attempt to install it if it's not already present.
- **Terminal Emulator**: The script supports either `xterm` or `gnome-terminal`. Ensure one of these is installed.
- **wmctrl** (optional): This tool can be used for automatically arranging terminal windows, though it's not mandatory.

##Installation

To set up the necessary components, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hacksudo/DdosHping3.git
   cd DdosHping3
